# electron-boilerplate

A minimalistic boilerplate for [Electron runtime](http://electron.atom.io). Tested on macOS, Windows and Linux.  

This project doesn't impose on you any frontend framework and tries to give you only the 'electron' part of technology stack with bare minimum of dependencies. This enables you to pick your favourite tools to build the actual app.

# Quick start

The sole development dependency of this project is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), so make sure you have it installed.
Then type the following commands known to every Node developer...
```
git clone https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate.git
cd electron-boilerplate
npm install
npm start
```
...and boom! You have a running desktop application on your screen.

# Structure of the project

The application consists of two main folders...

`src` - files within this folder get transpiled or compiled (because Electron can't use them directly).

`app` - contains all static assets (put here images, css, html etc.) which don't need any pre-processing.

The build process compiles the content of the `src` folder and puts it into the `app` folder, so after the build has finished, your `app` folder contains the full, runnable application.

Treat `src` and `app` folders like two halves of one bigger thing.

The drawback of this design is that `app` folder contains some files which should be git-ignored and some which shouldn't (see `.gitignore` file). But this two-folders split makes development builds much, much faster.

# Development

## Starting the app

```
npm start
```

## The build pipeline

Build process uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). The entry-points of your code are the files `src/background.js` and `src/app.js`. Webpack will follow all `import` statements starting from those files and compile code of the whole dependency tree into one `.js` file for each entry point.

[Babel](http://babeljs.io/) is also utilised, but mainly for its great error messages. Electron runs under the hood latest Chromium, hence most of the new JavaScript features is already natively supported.

## Environments

Environmental variables are done in a bit different way (not via `process.env`). Env files are plain JSONs in `config` directory, and build process dynamically links one of them as an `env` module. You can import it wherever in code you need access to the environment.
```js
import env from "env";
console.log(env.name);
```

## Upgrading Electron version

To do so edit `package.json`:
```json
"devDependencies": {
  "electron": "1.7.9"
}
```
*Side note:* [Electron authors recommend](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/electron-versioning/) to use fixed version here.

## Adding npm modules to your app

Remember to respect the split between `dependencies` and `devDependencies` in `package.json` file. Your distributable app will contain modules listed in `dependencies` after running the release script.

*Side note:* If the module you want to use in your app is a native one (not pure JavaScript but compiled binary) you should first  run `npm install name_of_npm_module --save` and then `npm run postinstall` to rebuild the module for Electron. You need to do this once after you're first time installing the module. Later on the postinstall script will fire automatically with every `npm install`.

# Testing

Run all tests:
```
npm test
```

## Unit

```
npm run unit
```
Using [electron-mocha](https://github.com/jprichardson/electron-mocha) test runner with the [Chai](http://chaijs.com/api/assert/) assertion library. You can put your spec files wherever you want within the `src` directory, just name them with the `.spec.js` pattern.

## End to end

```
npm run e2e
```
Using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Spectron](http://electron.atom.io/spectron/). This task will run all files in `e2e` directory with pattern `.e2e.js`.

# Making a release

To package your app into an installer use command:
```
npm run release
```

It will start the packaging process. Once the process finished, the `dist` directory will contain your distributable file.

We use [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) to handle the packaging process. It has a lot of [customization options](https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration), which you can declare under `"build"` key in `package.json`.

You can package your app cross-platform from a single operating system, [electron-builder kind of supports this](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build), but there are limitations and asterisks. That's why this boilerplate doesn't do that by default.
