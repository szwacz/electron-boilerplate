electron-boilerplate
==============
Comprehensive boilerplate application for [Electron](http://electron.atom.io).  

This project gives you mainly three things:

1. Cross-platform development environment (works the same way on OSX, Windows and Linux).
2. Basic structure for Electron app.
3. Scripts to generate installers of your app for all three operating systems.

By the way, there is a twin project to this one: [nw-boilerplate](https://github.com/szwacz/nw-boilerplate), which is the same thing but for NW.js.

# Quick start
The only development dependency of this project is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). So just make sure you have it installed.
Then type few commands known to every Node developer...
```
git clone https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate.git
cd electron-boilerplate
npm install
npm start
```
... and boom! You have running desktop application on your screen.

# Structure of the project

There are **two** `package.json` files:  

#### 1. For development
Sits on path: `electron-boilerplate/package.json`. Here you declare dependencies for your development environment and build scripts. **This file is not distributed with real application!**

Also here you declare the version of Electron runtime you want to use:
```json
"devDependencies": {
  "electron-prebuilt": "^0.24.0"
}
```

#### 2. For your application
Sits on path: `electron-boilerplate/app/package.json`. This is **real** manifest of your application. Declare your app dependencies here.

### Project's folders

- `app` - code of your application goes here.
- `config` - place for you to declare environment specific stuff.
- `build` - in this folder lands built, runnable application.
- `releases` - ready for distribution installers will land here.
- `resources` - resources for particular operating system.
- `tasks` - build and development environment scripts.


# Development

#### Installation

```
npm install
```
It will also download Electron runtime, and install dependencies for second `package.json` file inside `app` folder.

#### Starting the app

```
npm start
```

#### Adding pure-js npm modules to your app

Remember to add your dependency to `app/package.json` file, so do:
```
cd app
npm install name_of_npm_module --save
```

#### Adding native npm modules to your app

If you want to install native module you need to compile it agains Electron, not Node.js you are firing in command line by typing `npm install` [(Read more)](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules.md).
```
npm run app-install -- name_of_npm_module
```
Of course this method works also for pure-js modules, so you can use it all the time if you're able to remember such an ugly command.

#### Module loader

How about splitting your JavaScript code into modules? This project supports it by new ES6 syntax (thanks to [babel](https://babeljs.io/)). ES6 modules are translated into AMD (RequireJS) modules. The main advantage of this setup is that you can use ES6 -> RequireJS for your own modules, and at the same time have normal access to node's `require()` to obtain stuff from npm.
```javascript
// Modules you write are required through new ES6 syntax
// (It will be translated into AMD definition).
import myOwnModule from './my_own_module';
// Node.js (npm) modules are required the same way as always
// (so you can still access all the goodness of npm).
var moment = require('moment');
```

#### Unit tests

electron-boilerplate has preconfigured [jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html) unit test runner. To run it go with standard:
```
npm test
```
You don't have to declare paths to spec files in any particular place. The runner will search through the project for all `*.spec.js` files and include them automatically.


# Making a release

**Note:** There are various icon and bitmap files in `resources` directory. Those are used in installers and are intended to be replaced by your own graphics.

To make ready for distribution installer use command:
```
npm run release
```
It will start the packaging process for operating system you are running this command on. Ready for distribution file will be outputted to `releases` directory.

You can create Windows installer only when running on Windows, the same is true for Linux and OSX. So to generate all three installers you need all three operating systems.

## Overriding location of Electron runtime

By default, the `npm run release` command will create a new build using the Electron runtime that is automatically installed by the `electron-prebuilt` package. If for some reason you need to override this behavior and explicitly specify the location of the desired runtime (e.g. you want to create a Windows build for 32-bit architecture on a 64-bit machine), you can do so by setting a value for `runtimePath` in the `package.json` file located in the root folder of this project:

```
{
  "runtimePath": "/temp/electron/Electron.app"
}
```


## Special precautions for Windows
As installer [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page) is used. You have to install it (version 3.0), and add NSIS folder to PATH in Environment Variables, so it is reachable to scripts in this project (path should look something like `C:/Program Files (x86)/NSIS`).
